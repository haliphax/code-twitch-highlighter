# Twitch Highlighter for VS Code

Allows Twitch viewers to redeem channel points in order to highlight a line in
the streamer's text editor

## Setup

After it is installed, you will need to at least provide the channel
(`twitchHighlighter.channel`) and channel points reward identifier
(`twitchHighlighter.rewardId`) before the extension will work. Once these
values have been set, reload your editor.
